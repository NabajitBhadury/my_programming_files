let 🍎 = 5
let 🍌 = 10
let 🍊 = 15

// Arithmetic operations
let 🍏 = 🍎 + 🍌 // 🍏 is now 15
let 🍐 = 🍊 - 🍌 // 🍐 is now 5
let 🍓 = 🍎 * 🍌 // 🍓 is now 50
let 🍈 = 🍊 / 🍌 // 🍈 is now 1
let 🍒 = 🍊 % 🍌 // 🍒 is now 5 (remainder)

// Logical operations
let 🍍 = 🍎 < 🍌 // 🍍 is now true

// Conditional statement using emojis
if 🍌 > 🍎 {
    print("🍌 is greater than 🍎")

// Output: 🍌 is greater than 🍎

// Combining emojis with regular variable names
let x = 7
let 🍋 = 🍎 + x // 🍋 is now 12

print(🍋) // Output: 12
